#Choose an API from RapidAPI that interests youâ€”make sure it has a free tier and simple authentication. 
# Write a Python script that makes a request to your selected API, using the appropriate endpoint and parameters to retrieve data. 
# Save the response data to a variable, and handle it as JSON to work with nested structures. 
# Extract a specific item from the nested dictionary in the response, and 
# print a statement that meaningfully displays this information.
