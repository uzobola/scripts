#Create a date.py script that is a date simulator and does the following:
#User inputs who is on the date with them
#User inputs their budget for the date
#Print the restaurant menu (your group created this!) 
#User inputs their food/drink item choices from a restaurant menu list (for themselves and their date)
#Script tells the user how much money they have left after each order.
#At the end of the date user must agree to pay the bill and then their final budget is shown to them.
#Challenge: Based on all the user inputs, the script should decide whether the user will get a second date or not and tell the user the decision.
